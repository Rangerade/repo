# Due to misinform data/information and no response from selected classmates, I didn't use any of the Week 5 dicussion dataset. I researched another dataset online
# Using a dataset that calculates unemployment rate during COVID-19 in 5 randomly selected states during 2020


df <- read.csv(file = theUr2, header = TRUE, apr = ",")
head(df)
  colnames(df)

# Reorganizing code for a viewing column from greatest to least in 2020

df2<-rename(df,State=State.Area, Unemployment_percentage=Percent.....of.Labor.Force.Unemployed.in.State.Area)
head(df2)

New York<-subset(df2,State=="New York")
ggplot(NewYork, aes(x=NewYork$Year, y=NewYork$Unemployment_percentage, fill=NewYork$Month)) + geom_line(color = "blue")

# Using this code, a graph should generate and display showcasing the unemployment rate in New York that it calculated between 5.4% & 16% during 2020
