# In order to determine the easternmost airport, the dataset show airports with a latitude in the range of 44 to 50 and a longitude of -65 to -75 which included airports on the far eastern section of the USA.

# The data set above shows that the windiest day at a New York City airport on February 12th, 2013 occurred at EWR but this data is an outlier as the windspeed is false. 
# The windiest airport was LGA totaling a windspeed of 23 mph.
